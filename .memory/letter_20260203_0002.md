# Letter to Myself (Session Handoff)

**Date:** 2026-02-03

## 1. Executive Summary
* **Goal:** Fix plugin marketplace installation issues and improve user experience
* **Current Status:** Pushed v1.0.2 with fixes; waiting for user to test on EC2

## 2. The "Done" List (Context Anchor)
* Fixed duplicate hooks error by removing explicit `hooks` reference from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (Claude Code auto-loads `hooks/hooks.json`)
* Bumped version from 1.0.0 → 1.0.1 → 1.0.2 to trigger marketplace cache refresh
* Updated `scripts/setup-api-key.sh` to install skills to `~/.claude/skills/` with short names
* Renamed skill from `letter-checkpoint` to `checkpoint` in frontmatter for consistency
* Skills now install as `/letter-init` and `/checkpoint` instead of `/letter-for-my-future-self:letter-init`

## 3. The "Pain" Log (CRITICAL)
* **Tried:** Simply pushing fix without version bump
* **Failed:** Marketplace kept serving cached v1.0.0 even after uninstall/reinstall
* **Workaround:** Must bump version number in plugin.json to force marketplace cache invalidation
* *Note:* Always bump version when fixing plugin issues - marketplace caches aggressively

* **Tried:** Using `/letter-init` skill name
* **Failed:** "Unknown skill" - plugin skills are namespaced as `/plugin-name:skill-name`
* **Workaround:** Setup hook now copies skills to `~/.claude/skills/` for short names

## 4. Active Variable State
* Plugin version: 1.0.2
* Branch: main (clean after push)
* Files modified: `plugin.json`, `setup-api-key.sh`, `skills/letter-checkpoint/skill.md`
* EC2 test server: `~/q-records-storemanager` project

## 5. Immediate Next Steps
1. [ ] User tests v1.0.2 on EC2 - clear cache, reinstall, verify `/checkpoint` works
2. [ ] Verify SessionStart hook auto-creates `.memory/` and `.github/` structure
3. [ ] Consider adding `/init` as even shorter alias for `/letter-init`
