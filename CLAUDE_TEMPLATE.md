# Project Rules & Context

## 🧠 Memory Protocol
This project uses the **Letter to Myself** agent.

1.  **Startup:** Always check the `.memory/` directory. Read the file with the highest number (e.g., `letter_05.md`) to understand the current state.
2.  **Shutdown:** Before exiting or when asked to `/checkpoint`, use the `save-checkpoint` tool to write the next sequential letter.

## 📝 Coding Standards
(Add your normal coding standards here, e.g., TypeScript strict mode, Python PEP8, etc.)
